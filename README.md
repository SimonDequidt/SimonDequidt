👋 Hello, I'm Simon, a former Quantitative Analyst at Société Générale with a strong foundation in engineering. Currently pursuing an MSc in Financial Engineering at EDHEC, I specialize in leveraging Python for quantitative analysis, employing my expertise in mathematics, market finance, and economics.

🚀 In my previous projects, I've developed LSTM models to predict VIX dynamics during high volatility periods and applied regression on macroeconomic variables for sales predictions in time series. 

💼 With a focus on market finance, my professional journey as a quant analyst has honed my skills in Python, R, and C++, with a primary emphasis on Python for its versatility and efficiency.

🌐 Having contributed to projects at the intersection of finance and technology, I bring a unique perspective and skill set to the table. My background includes hands-on experience in the trading domain, and I am passionate about furthering my expertise in this field.

📈 As someone who values resilience, hard work, and the joy of the journey, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of quantitative analysis and trading.

Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities at the intersection of finance and technology!
